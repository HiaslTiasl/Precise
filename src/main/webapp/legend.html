		<h2>Tasks</h2>
		
		<figure>

		<p>
		A task represents work that is foreseen in certain locations by some craft.
		Whenever a task is present in a diagram, this means that the corresponding activity
		has to be executed in all its locations in order to successfully complete the project.
		Then, we can add more constraints to a task using the concepts of Order and Exclusiveness.
		
		<p>
		To create a new task, first click <button class="btn btn-default">Add task</button> and then
		click at the position in the diagram where you want to create the task.
		A popup window will appear where you can further specify the task.
		You must at least specify a task definition by first selecting the phase to which the task belongs
		and then selecting the task definition.
		If you are done, click on <button class="btn btn-primary">Create</button> to confirm and the task
		will appear at the specified position.
		You can then select the task by clicking on it, which opens the task's properties on the right.
		Here you can change the properties, define the task's locations, and specify
		further constraints on the task (see sections below).
		When you are done, click <button class="btn btn-primary">Done</button> to confirm.
		You can remove a task by selecting it and then clicking on <button class="btn btn-default">Remove</button>. 
		
		<h3>Order</h3>
		
		By default, the order in which a task is executed in its locations is not specified, any order is fine.
		To change that, we can define an explicit order to change that.
		For each attribute of the task's phase, we assign one of four possible order types that define how this
		attribute contributes to the ordering:
		<ul>
			<li><code>NONE</code>:
				Ignore this attribute (default)
			<li><code>PARALLEL</code>:
				Partition/Parallelize values of this attribute.
				All following specifications only apply within the same value of this attribute.
			<li><code>ASCENDING</code>:
				Values of this attribute are ordered ascending.
			<li><code>DESCENDING</code>:
				Values of this attribute are ordered descending.
		</ul>
		
		For an example, consider a project with two sectors <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> representing two separate buildings.
		To express that the task <em>Scaffolding Installation</em> should be performed from bottom to top,
		we can then set the attribute <em>level</em> to <code>ASCENDING</code> and leave all other attributes to <code>NONE</code>.
		This means that the first level must be finished in both sectors <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> before we can progress to the
		next level.
		However, if <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> are in fact two independent buildings that can be built in parallel, this might
		be too restrictive.
		Instead, we want to apply the order on the level only within each building, so for progressing to the next level
		we do not have to wait until the level is finished in other sectors.
		We can express this by also setting the attribute <em>sector</em> to <code>PARALLEL</code>
		
		<h3>Exclusiveness</h3>
		
		<figure>

			<figcaption>Graphical representation of a task with an explicit exclusiveness constraint.</figcaption>
		</figure>

		<p>
		Another aspect of tasks is the scope of their exclusiveness.
		By default, every task is exclusive at unit scope, meaning no to tasks can be performed in one construction unit at the same time.
		To increase the scope of the exclusiveness of a task, we can explicitly select attributes to which a task is exclusive.
		
		If for instance we say that the Task <em>Scaffolding Installation</em> is exclusive at <em>sector</em> and <em>level</em>,
		once we start that task in a location, no other tasks can be executed in the same level in the same section until
		<em>Scaffolding Installation</em> finished there.

		<h2>Dependencies</h2>
		
		<figure>
			<img src="img/dependency.png"/>
			<figcaption>Graphical representation of a dependency.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		Dependencies represent precedence constraints among tasks.
		Graphically, they are represented as arrows to indicate that the source task needs to be finished
		before the target task can start.
		In the example above, we need to finish <em>Concrete Pouring</em> in all locations before we can start
		<em>Pipes Installation</em> anywhere.
		
		<p>
		To create a new dependency, first click on the source task, then on <button class="btn btn-default">Add dependency</button>,
		then on the target task.
		The new dependency will immediately appear.
		or on the red cross symbol on top of the dependency.
		To modify properties of the dependencies (see sections below), click on it to select it and show it in the properties panel.
		There you can edit the properties and click on <button class="btn btn-primary">Done</button> to confirm.
		To change the layout, you can use control points.
		Click on a dependency to select it and you will see its control points, which can be moved around.
		To create a new control point, double-click at the dependency.
		To remove it afterwards, click on the bubble near the control point.
		You can remove a dependency by selecting it and then clicking either on <button class="btn btn-default">Remove</button>
		 
		<h3>Scope</h3>

		<figure>
			<img src="img/dependency-scope.png"/>
			<figcaption>Graphical representation of a dependency with a scope.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		The scope of a dependency can be refined by providing a list of attributes.
		For example, the above figure shows a dependency that only applies within common <em>levels</em>.
		As a result, in each levels we need to perform <em>Scaffolding Installation</em> before <em>Concrete Pouring</em>.
		If we wanted to further narrow down the scope of the dependencies to levels per sector, we could label the dependency 
		with both attributes <em>sector</em> and <em>level</em>.
		
		<h3>Alternate Precedence</h3>
		
		<figure>
			<img src="img/dependency-alternate.png"/>
			<figcaption>Graphical representation of an alternate precedence.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		An alternate precedence is a scoped dependency with an additional constraint:
		When the source task is finished in a location of the given scope, it must also wait for the target task to be finished there
		until it can proceed to the next location.
		The graphical representation indicates this waiting behavior by the cross near the source task.
		We can think of it as some sort of waiting constraint on the source task, which is indicated by the cross near the source task.
		In the above example, we have an alternate precedence from <em>Scaffolding Installation</em> to <em>Concrete Pouring</em>
		at the scope.
		This means that in each level we must perform <em>Scaffolding Installation</em> before <em>Concrete Pouring</em>,
		and that <em>Concrete Pouring</em> must be finished in a level in order to start with <em>Scaffolding Installation</em>
		in another level.
		
		<h3>Chain Precedence</h3>
		
		<figure>
			<img src="img/dependency-chain.png"/>
			<figcaption>Graphical representation of a chain precedence.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		A chain precedence is a scoped dependency with an additional constraint:
		When the source task is finished in the given scope, no other tasks can be performed until the target task is started.
		By default, dependencies only require that the source must be executed before the target, but they do not prevent
		other tasks to be executed in between.
		By using chain precedences, we can change that.
		In the above example, when we finished <em>Scaffolding Installation</em> in some level, we cannot perform other tasks
		in that level until we started <em>Concrete Pouring there</em>.
